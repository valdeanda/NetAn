NetAn consist of a single script  that uses the output derived from [Metamis sofware](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27887570) sofware,  which is a directed network , and compute several statistics 
Please note that any **networked from another software can also be used** ie [WGCNA: Weighted Correlation Network Analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WGCNA/index.html), [MENA:Molecular Ecological Network Analyses](http://129.15.40.240/mena/).

The main script :  [NetworkAnalysis.py](./scripts/NetworkAnalysis.py) recieves the above mentioned files and compute several topological features such as density, mean degree, hubs, connected components, clustering coefficient modularity etc.  


# Dependencies 

In order to use the script, the following dependencies must be installed first.
1. [ Python3  ](https://www.python.org/)
2. [Networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) 
3. [Community library](https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain/) 

```
sudo -H pip install python-louvain
```

Some extra python libreries 

Numpy and matplotlib
```
sudo pip2 install numpy matplotlib
```
Librarpy tk 

```
sudo apt-get install python-tk
```

# Running the script     
```
python Networks/scripts/NetworkAnalysis.py -d Networks/data/a_phylum_consensus.txt
```
In the case of having  undirected networks , you can use the  -u option
```
python Networks/scripts/NetworkAnalysis.py -u Networks/data/a_phylum_consensus.txt
```

# Analyzing the output 

Once the program has finished, the following message will appears in the terminal
```

### If you want to customize your networks..

We recomend to use [visNetwork](https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/). 
We provide a simple data test  containing the nodes and the edges and the [R script](./scripts/plot_graph.R)
to obtain the following [interactive graph](https://valdeanda.github.io/NetAn/testNetwork.html)
